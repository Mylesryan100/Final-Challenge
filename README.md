# Final-Challenge

1. What accessibility enhancements were the most challenging to implement, and why?

Answer: Some accessibility enhancements I found challenging were meeting all the requirements and making the necessary changes like replacing placeholders with the correct labels,and replacing the <div> with more proper structures for semantic HTML like <main>, <form>, <figure> and even <section>, to show proper semantic HTML structure.

2. How do ARIA attributes improve the experience for users relying on assistive technologies?

Answer: Aria attributes improve users experiences by offering users who have disabilities or who are more reliant screen readers more descriptive and informative text or navigation. For example ARIA provides more description and guidance by clarifying relationships between elements by linking labels,controls, and descriptions together for screen reader users.

3. What tools did you use to check color contrast, and how did they help?

Answer:I used webaim.org to check if certain color contrasts met the required WCAG 2.1 standards for AA or AAA.
These tools also helped and showed me how to look for darker font colors so the text is more visible and understandable for users.
